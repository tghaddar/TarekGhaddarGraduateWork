I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant R\&D Staff Member - High Performance Computing (HPC) Nuclear Engineer (Requisition ID 813) in the Reactor Physics Group in RNSD at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I will be receiving my PhD in Nuclear Engineering from Texas A\&M University in August of 2019. My advisor is Prof. Jean Ragusa, and my areas of interest and experience include computational radiation transport, scientific computing and analysis, and parallel computing. 

My graduate work has focused on optimizing radiation transport sweeps in Texas A\&M's flagship massively parallel deterministic finite element radiation transport code, PDT. For my MS project, I implemented a 2D and 2D extruded unstructured meshing capability in PDT, and I followed up by implemented a load balancing algorithm in order to combat the imbalanced partitions that were introduced by unstructured meshes. My doctoral work generalized and expanded on this by building a sweep optimization code. This implements a general sweep scheduler and time-to-solution estimator and returns the optimal partitioning scheme for a given problem. Through my graduate work, I learned or gained experience in object oriented C++, radiation transport methods, working within a collaborative production level code, scripting in bash and Python, and parallel computing with MPI, OpenMP, and other parallel libraries.

I also served two internships at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). While interning in the XCP-3 group at LANL, I implemented analytic single event charged particle capabilities in the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code. This work provided me with significant experience studying Monte Carlo methods, charged particle transport, and the Fortran computing language. 

While interning with the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors (CASL) at ORNL, I updated the MPACT reactor simulation code's Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) capabilities utilizing the Kokkos C++ library. Using Kokkos, I accelerated the fission and scattering source calculations by writing interoperable Fortran/C++ code to perform these calculations on a GPU. This work provided me with my first experience coding on GPUs, which have a significant future in scientific computing.

ORNL has always pushed the limits of computational nuclear engineering with a variety of codes and new computing facilities, such as Summit. I believe with my experience in computational radiation transport and parallel computing, I would be a great fit for Reactor Physics Group and the direction it is headed. 

%I understand this position, as an Associate level, is considered beyond what a recent PhD graduate would start at. I was unable to find any postings in the Assistant, or even Postdoc, level that aligned with my strengths, however. I am willing to be reassigned a more appropriate position level, if desired.
%Please let me know if there are any other materials or information that will assist you in processing my application.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
