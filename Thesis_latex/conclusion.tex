\chapter{\uppercase {Conclusion}}

In conclusion, the load balancing algorithm outlined in Chapter \ref{ch:motivation} works well for more symmetric problems with a lot of features, and even works well for particularly unbalanced problems. As shown in Chapter~\ref{ch:results}, its effectiveness depends on the maximum triangle area used, and the number of subsets the user chooses to decompose the problem domain into. 

\tcr{any recommendation for future work? this is somewhat mandatory. Good research should always lead to new questions}
