\chapter{\uppercase {Results}}

\tcr{give the dimension of your domains. I suppose since XS are in 1/cm, the domain and the trinalge areas are in cm2 but say it}

The following sections will showcase the new unstructured meshing capability both in 2D and 3D, the metric behavior and convergence for three test cases, and solution verification for pure absorber and pure scatterer 2D slab problems. 

\section{2D and 2D Extruded Meshing Capability}

\tcr{not sure what you want to start with what could be the best results. Why not build up momentum and show this as the grand finale?}


Figure \ref{IM12D} showcases the 2D meshing capability, and Fig. \ref{IM13D} showcases the same mesh extruded in the z  direction.



\section{Test Cases for Metric Behavior and Convergence}

In order to showcase the behavior of the load balancing metric \tcr{it would be good to provide the equation number for the metric, for clarity}, three test cases are presented. Figure \ref{opp} shows the first test case, a large domain with two pins in opposite corners of the domain. Figure \ref{same} shows the same size domain but with the pins on the same side.These are two theoretically very unbalanced cases, as geometrically there are two features located distantly from each other with an empty geometry throughout the rest of the domain. Figure \ref{lattice} shows a lattice and reflector, which due to it's denser and repeated geometry, theoretically is a more balanced problem. 

A series of 162 inputs was constructed for each case. Table \ref{study} shows the the parameters that will change in each input. The maximum triangle area varied from the coarsest possible to 0.01, and the number of subsets, $N$, varies from 2x2 to 10x10.

\section{Metric Behavior and Convergence}

For each test case, the 162 input parameters outlined in Table \ref{study} are run twice, once with no load balancing iterations, and once with ten load balancing iterations. The best metric is reported and recorded. Three figures for each test cases are presented below: the first figure will show the metric behavior for no iterations, the second figure will show the metric behavior for each input run with ten load balancing iterations, and the third figure will show a ratio of the ten iteration runs over the no iteration runs.

Figure \ref{oppnoiter} shows the metric behavior for Fig. \ref{opp}. The maximum metric value is 24.7650, and occurs when Fig. \ref{opp} is run with 8x8 subsets and a maximum triangle area of 1.6 cm\textsuperscript{2}. The minimum metric value is 1.0016 and occurs when Fig. \ref{opp} is run with 4x4 subsets and a maximum triangle area of 0.04 cm\textsuperscript{2}.

Figure \ref{oppdiff} shows the difference in metric behavior for Fig. \ref{opp}. This difference is calculated by dividing the metric with no iterations by the metric with 10 iterations.

The minimum improvement has a value of very close to 1.0 and occurs for many of the inputs.

\section{Solution Verification}

The test problem ran for solution verification is a pure absorbing slab with $\Sigma_a = 0.3 \text{cm}^{-1}$. It has reflecting boundary conditions on the top and the bottom, an incident isotropic flux on the left, and a vacuum boundary on the left. The reflecting boundaries are implemented to simulate an infinite slab in the y direction. The analytical solution to this problem is exponential \tcr{give the analytical expression and compare the ratio of analytical values (inlet/outlet)  with the numerical ones}, and with the flux placed on a logarithmic scale, we see the flux linearly decrease in the x direction.
