\chapter{\uppercase {The Transport Equation}}
\label{ch:transporteq} 

The steady-state neutron transport equation describes the behavior of neutrons in a medium and is given by Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport}:
\begin{multline}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo)  = \\
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo') 
+ S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\label{continuous transport}
\end{multline}
where $\vec{\Omega}\cdot \vec\nabla\psi$ is the leakage term and $\Sigma_t\psi$ is the total collision term (absorption, outscatter, and within group scattering). These are the loss terms of the neutron transport equation. The right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport} represents the gain terms, where $S_{ext}$ is the external source of neutrons and $\int_{0}^{\infty}dE'\int_{4\pi}d\Omega'\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo')$ is the inscatter term, which represents all neutrons scattering from energy $E'$ and direction $\vo'$ into energies about $E$ and directions about $\vo$. 

Without loss of generality for the research problem at hand, we assume isotropic scattering for simplicity. The double differential scattering cross section, $\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)$, no longer depends on direction and is divided by $4\pi$ to reflect isotropic behavior. This yields:
\begin{multline}
\label{isotropic}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo) \\ = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E) \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \psi(\vr,E',\vo')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) \nonumber
\end{multline}
\begin{equation}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E) \phi(\vr,E')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\end{equation}
where we have introduced the scalar flux as the integral of the angular flux:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_scalar_flux}
\phi(\vr,E') = \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \psi(\vr,E',\vo').
\end{equation}
The next step to solving the transport equation is to discretize in energy, yielding Eq.~\eqref{multigroup} the multigroup transport equation:
\begin{equation}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_g(\vr,\vo) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_g(\vr,\vo) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g}(\vr,\vo), \quad \text{for } 1 \le g \le G
\label{multigroup}
\end{equation}
where the multigroup transport equations now form a system of coupled equations. 

Next, we discretize in angle using the discrete ordinates method, whereby an angular quadrature $\left( \vo_m, w_m \right)_{1 \le m \le M}$ is used to solve the above equations along a given set of directions $\vo_m$:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{g,m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_{g,m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g,m}(\vr),
\label{angle}
\end{equation}
where the subscript $m$ is introduced to describe the angular flux in direction $m$. We notice that the subscript is not added to our inscatter term because of the isotropic scattering assumption and because the scalar flux does not depend on angle. However, in order to evaluate the scalar flux, we employ the angular weights $w_m$ and the angular flux solutions
$\psi_m$ to numerically perform the angular integration:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_scalar_flux_2}
\phi_g(\vr) \approx \sum_{m=1}^{m=M} w_m \psi_{g,m}(\vr).
\end{equation}

From Equation~\eqref{multigroup}, it is clear that we are solving a sequence of transport equations, one equation per group. Therefore, all transport equations are of the following form:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t}(\vr) \psi_{m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\Sigma_{s}(\vr)\phi(\vr) + q^{ext+inscat}_m(\vr) = q_m(\vr),
\end{equation}
where the group index notation is omitted for brevity.

In order to obtain the solution for this discrete form of the transport equation, an iterative process called source iteration is introduced. This is shown below for the one-group transport equation, Eq. ~\eqref{iteration}:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec\nabla \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) + \Sigma_t \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) = q_m^{(l)}(\vr),
\label{iteration}
\end{equation}
where the right hand side terms of Eq.~\eqref{angle} have been combined into one general source term, $q_m$. The angular flux of iteration $(l+1)$ is calculated using the $(l^{th})$ value of the scalar flux.

After the angular and energy dependence have been accounted for, Eq.~\eqref{iteration} must be discretized in space as well. We use a discontinuous Galerkin approximation in space,  and the solution across a cell interface is connected based on an upwind approach, where face outflow radiation becomes face inflow radiation for the downwind cells. The solution is obtained by meshing the domain and solving the spatial problem one cell at a time for a given direction. Sweeping the mesh and solving one cell at a time is possible utilizing one of three popular discretization techniques: finite difference\cite{fd}, finite volume\cite{fd}, or discontinuous finite element\cite{Reed}. Figure \ref{sweeps} shows the sweep ordering for a given direction on both a structured and unstructured mesh.

The number in each cell represents the order in which the cells are solved. All cells must receive the solution downwind from them before solving for their own solution. This dependency can be represented and stored as a task dependence graph, shown in Fig. \ref{tdg}.
