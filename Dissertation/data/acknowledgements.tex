\indent I would like to thank Dr. Jean Ragusa for toeing the line between demanding and understanding perfectly. I know I haven't made your job as my advisor easy. 

Thank you to my committee, Drs. Adams, Amato, and Morel, for the feedback and advice when needed to push this work to completion.

A special thank you to Daryl Hawkins, a man I'm convinced is the most overworked code developer on the planet. This work would have been impossible without him. 

Thank you to Andrew Till for always being a sounding board for academic ideas, and thank you to Ian Halvic for dealing with my less than fine moments in the office. 

Thank you to Dillon Herring for his accelerated effort on his Master's project, which helped the completion of this dissertation.

To Nicolas Quintanar, Brian Ng, and David Saucier, thank you for keeping my life fun and full of life. 

To the CERT team, thank you for your constant support in all of my research endeavors.
