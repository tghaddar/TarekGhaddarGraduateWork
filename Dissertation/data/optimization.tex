\chapter{PARTITIONING OPTMIZIATION \label{cha:optimization}}
\section{Method}
With confidence in the time-to-solution estimator, it is used as the objective function in two optimization methods. The first optimization method utilizes scipy's optimize library, and the second method utilizes knowledge of a problem's mesh layout to assist in partition placement.

\subsection{Scipy optimize}
  The scipy optimize library provides many tools for optimizing an input function with local and global minimization techniques. Our usage of the optimize library relies on the minimize function, using the basinhopping method as the global optimizer, and the constrained Nelder-Mead method as the local optimizer.

\subsection{human optimization}
  
  The ``black box'' method using scipy optimize's basinhopping and constrained Nelder-Mead minimizers is functional for small parameter spaces. However, even with modestly large parameter spaces such as the one seen in the Level 2 experiment (Fig. \ref{level2_nocut}), the time-to-solution estimator function is not smooth enough for scipy optimize to honor the constraints or bounds of the problem, leading to the time-to-solution estimator crashing. This lead to the development of an alternative method.  

  The ``human optimization'' method utilizes the geometrical information of the problem to attempt to find optimal cuts. This method prioritizes finding cut line locations that cut along a ``natural boundary''. A natural boundary is a subset boundary that coincides with the geometrical features of the mesh. In Fig. \ref{partitioning_example}, we notice natural boundaries every centimeter in each dimension.

\label{partitioning_example}
\end{figure}

In order to identify these natural boundaries, we analyze the detailed cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the vertices in each dimension. The jumps in the CDF correspond to natural boundaries. Figure \ref{vert_cdf} shows the x-vertex CDF of the mesh in Fig. \ref{partitioning_example}.

\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{../figures/xvertexcdf.pdf}
\caption{The x-vertex CDF of the mesh shown in Fig. \ref{partitioning_example}}.
\label{vert_cdf}
\end{figure}
To identify where the jumps in the CDF occur, we take the gradient of the CDF and isolate the largest discontinuities in it. Figure \ref{gradcdf} plots the gradient of the CDF shown in Fig. \ref{vert_cdf}.
\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.75]{../figures/gradcdf.pdf}
\caption{The gradient of the CDF shown in Fig. \ref{vert_cdf}}.
\label{gradcdf}
\end{figure}
The largest discontinuities in Fig. \ref{gradcdf} occur at the instances where there are natural boundaries all the way through the mesh, or at 1 cm intervals.
