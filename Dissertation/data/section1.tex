\chapter{\uppercase {Introduction}}

The steady-state neutron transport equation describes the behavior of neutrons in a medium and is given by Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport}:
\begin{equation}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo)  =
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo') 
+ S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\label{continuous transport}
\end{equation}
where $\vec{\Omega}\cdot \vec\nabla\psi$ is the leakage term and $\Sigma_t\psi$ is the total collision term (absorption, outscatter, and within group scattering). These represent the loss terms of the neutron transport equation. The right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport} represents the gain terms, where $S_{ext}$ is the external source of neutrons and $\int_{0}^{\infty}dE'\int_{4\pi}d\Omega'\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo')$ is the inscatter term, which represents all neutrons scattering from energy $E'$ and direction $\vo'$ into $dE$ about energy $E$ and $d\Omega$ about direction $\vo$.

Without loss of generality for the problem at hand, we assume isotropic scattering for simplicity. The double differential scattering cross section, $\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)$, has its angular dependence present in the integral, and is divided by $4\pi$ to reflect isotropic behavior. This yields:
\begin{align}
\label{isotropic}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo)  
& = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E) \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \psi(\vr,E',\vo')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) \nonumber \\
& = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E) \phi(\vr,E')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\end{align}
where we have introduced the scalar flux as the integral of the angular flux:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_scalar_flux}
\phi(\vr,E') = \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \psi(\vr,E',\vo').
\end{equation}
The next step to solving the transport equation is to discretize in energy, yielding Eq.~\eqref{multigroup}, the multigroup transport equation:
\begin{equation}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_g(\vr,\vo) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_g(\vr,\vo) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g}(\vr,\vo), \quad \text{for } 1 \le g \le G
\label{multigroup}
\end{equation}
where the multigroup transport equations now form a system of coupled equations. 

Next, we discretize in angle using the discrete ordinates method\cite{denovo}, whereby an angular quadrature $\left( \vo_m, w_m \right)_{1 \le m \le M}$ is used to solve the above equations along a given set of directions $\vo_m$:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{g,m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_{g,m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g,m}(\vr),
\label{angle}
\end{equation}
where the subscript $m$ is introduced to describe the angular flux in direction $m$. The subscript is not added to our inscatter term because of the isotropic scattering assumption and because the scalar flux does not depend on angle. However, in order to evaluate the scalar flux, we employ the angular weights $w_m$ and the angular flux solutions
$\psi_m$ to numerically perform the angular integration:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_scalar_flux_2}
\phi_g(\vr) \approx \sum_{m=1}^{m=M} w_m \psi_{g,m}(\vr).
\end{equation}

At this point, it is clear that we are solving a sequence of transport equations for one group and direction at a time. Therefore, all transport equations take the following form:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t}(\vr) \psi_{m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\Sigma_{s}(\vr)\phi(\vr) + q^{ext+inscat}_m(\vr) = q_m(\vr),
\end{equation}
where the group index is omitted for brevity.

In order to obtain the solution for this discrete form of the transport equation, an iterative process, source iteration, is introduced. This is shown by a simplified transport equation Eq. ~\eqref{iteration}:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec\nabla \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) + \Sigma_t \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) = q_m^{(l)}(\vr),
\label{iteration}
\end{equation}
where the right hand side terms of Eq.~\eqref{angle} have been combined into one general source term, $q_m$. The angular flux of iteration $(l+1)$ is calculated using the $(l^{th})$ value of the scalar flux.

After the angular and energy dependence have been accounted for, Eq.~\eqref{iteration} must be discretized in space as well. This is done by meshing the domain and utilizing one of three popular discretization techniques: finite difference\cite{fd}, finite volume\cite{fd}, or discontinuous finite element\cite{Reed}, allowing one cell at a time to be solved. The solution across a cell interface is connected based on an upwind approach, where face outflow radiation becomes face inflow radiation for the downwind cells. Figure \ref{sweeps} shows the sweep ordering for a given direction on both a structured and unstructured mesh.

The number in each cell represents the order in which the cells are solved. All cells must receive the solution downwind from them before they can begin solving. This process can be represented and stored as a task dependence graph, shown in Fig. \ref{tdg}.

Massively parallel transport sweeps have been shown to scale up to 750,000 cores on logically Cartesian grids. However, structured meshes are somewhat limiting when  simulating more complex problems and experiments, requiring the use of unstructured meshes in transport sweeps. While unstructured meshes provide the ability to simulate realistic problems, they introduce some challenges like unbalanced partitions, which can increase the time to solution. To combat this, PDT, Texas A\&M University's massively parallel deterministic transport code, introduced two load balancing algorithms that rely on moving the spatial partition boundaries, or cut planes (cut lines in 2D), throughout the mesh in order to obtain a roughly equivalent amount of cells (and therefore work) per processor. However, this sacrifices the optimal partitioning scheme\cite{mpadams2013} in favor of balance. We propose a method that weighs ideal load balancing against the consequences to the transport sweep in order to achieve the best possible time to solution.
