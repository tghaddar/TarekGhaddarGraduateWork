\chapter{\uppercase {The Deterministic Transport Sweep}}\label{cha:transport_sweeps}

The steady-state neutron transport equation describes the behavior of neutrons in a medium and is given by Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport}:
\begin{multline}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo)  = \\
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo')
+ S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\label{continuous transport}
\end{multline}
where $\vec{\Omega}\cdot \vec\nabla\psi$ is the leakage term and $\Sigma_t\psi$ is the total collision term (absorption, outscatter, and within group scattering). These represent the loss terms of the neutron transport equation. The right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport} represents the gain terms, where $S_{ext}$ is the external source of neutrons and $\int_{0}^{\infty}dE'\int_{4\pi}d\Omega'\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo')$ is the inscatter term, which represents all neutrons scattering from energy $E'$ and direction $\vo'$ into $dE$ about energy $E$ and $d\Omega$ about direction $\vo$.

Without loss of generality for the problem at hand, we assume isotropic scattering for simplicity. The double differential scattering cross section, $\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)$, has its angular dependence present in the integral, and is divided by $4\pi$ to reflect isotropic behavior. This yields:
\begin{align}
\label{isotropic}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) +\Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo)
& = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E) \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \psi(\vr,E',\vo')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) \nonumber \\
& = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E) \phi(\vr,E')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\end{align}
where we have introduced the scalar flux as the integral of the angular flux:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_scalar_flux}
\phi(\vr,E') = \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \psi(\vr,E',\vo').
\end{equation}
The next step to solving the transport equation is to discretize in energy, yielding Eq.~\eqref{multigroup}, the multigroup transport equation:
\begin{equation}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_g(\vr,\vo) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_g(\vr,\vo) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g}(\vr,\vo), \quad \text{for } 1 \le g \le G
\label{multigroup}
\end{equation}
where the multigroup transport equations now form a system of coupled equations.

Next, we discretize in angle using the discrete ordinates method\cite{denovo}, whereby an angular quadrature $\left( \vo_m, w_m \right)_{1 \le m \le M}$ is used to solve the above equations along a given set of directions $\vo_m$:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{g,m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_{g,m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g,m}(\vr),
\label{angle}
\end{equation}
where the subscript $m$ is introduced to denote the angular flux in direction $m$. In order to evaluate the scalar flux, we employ the angular weights $w_m$ and the angular flux solutions
$\psi_m$ to numerically perform the angular integration:
\begin{equation}
\label{def_scalar_flux_2}
\phi_g(\vr) \approx \sum_{m=1}^{m=M} w_m \psi_{g,m}(\vr).
\end{equation}

At this point, it is clear that we are solving a sequence of transport equations for one group and direction at a time. Therefore, all transport equations take the following form:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t}(\vr) \psi_{m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\Sigma_{s}(\vr)\phi(\vr) + q^{ext+inscat}_m(\vr) = q_m(\vr),
\end{equation}
where the group index is omitted for brevity.

In order to obtain the solution for this discrete form of the transport equation, an iterative process, source iteration, is introduced. This is shown in Eq. ~\eqref{iteration}:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec\nabla \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) + \Sigma_t \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) = q_m^{(l)}(\vr),
\label{iteration}
\end{equation}
where the right hand side terms of Eq.~\eqref{angle} have been combined into one general source term, $q_m$. The angular flux of iteration $(l+1)$ is calculated using the $(l^{th})$ value of the scalar flux.

After the angular and energy dependences have been accounted for, Eq.~\eqref{iteration} must be discretized in space as well. This is done by meshing the domain and utilizing one of three popular discretization techniques: finite difference\cite{fd}, finite volume\cite{fd}, or discontinuous finite element\cite{Reed}, allowing one cell at a time to be solved. The solution across a cell interface is connected based on an upwind approach, where face outflow radiation becomes face inflow radiation for the downwind cells. Figure \ref{sweeps} shows the sweep ordering for a given direction on both a structured and unstructured mesh.

The number in each cell represents the order in which the cells are solved.
Obtaining the solution for current cells in the sweep is dependent on the solution of downwind cells.
