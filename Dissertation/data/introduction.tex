\chapter{\uppercase {Introduction}}\label{cha:introduction}

The field of radiation transport studies the behavior of radiation throughout a six-dimensional phase space of time, space, energy, and direction. 
Radiation transport is commonly used for radiation shielding and criticality safety applications, as well as the general simulation of radiation in different environments. 

Radiation transport can be solved stochasticly or deterministicly.
The Monte Carlo method is used for stochastic radiation transport by tracking the behavior of a finite number of particles from their ``birth'' (for example, a neutron source) until their ``death'' (getting absorbed or escaping through a problem boundary), and statistically evaluating relevant quantities of interest (for example, neutron flux in a detector) \cite{shultis_mc}.
Codes such as MCNP \cite{MCNP} and SHIFT {\cite{shift} utilize the Monte Carlo method to perform high fidelity radiation transport simulations for a variety of experiments and problems. 

Deterministic transport discretizes the time, spatial, energy, and angular variables to obtain a numerical solution to the transport equation.
There are multiple popular methods to do this such as the method of characteristics and the transport sweeps, implemented by codes such as MPACT \cite{mpact}, Partisn \cite{partisn}, Denovo \cite{denovo}, and PDT \cite{mpadams2013,mpadams2015}. 

The work presented in this dissertation utilizes the transport sweep, a method that discretizes the Boltzmann transport equation \cite{bell_glasstone,zweifel,davison,duderstadt} down to a system of algebraic equations that can then be solved iteratively \cite{adams_larsen}.
It is often desirable to split the full system so that the memory cost can be distributed across multiple processors. 
The smaller linear system matrices often exhibit a lower block triangular structure whose solutions are easy to obtain.
With each block being thought of as a cell, the solution is obtained by following the flow of radiation, or ``marching'' through a mesh.

This ``marching'' or ``sweeping'' through a mesh gains complexity for unstructured and/or distributed meshes. Partitioning meshes in a balanced (near equivalent amount of work per processor) fashion that preserves mesh integrity can present challenges.
In addition, maintaining sweep performance for massively parallel simulations has and continues to be a thriving research topic.
The following dissertation chapters will discuss a brief history of the transport sweep, parallel transport sweeps, load balancing unstructured meshes for transport, a time-to-solution estimator, and optimizing partitions for parallel transport. 

\section*{The Deterministic Transport Sweep}

Chapter \ref{cha:transport_sweeps} introduces the steady-state neutron transport equation and the discretization process to obtain the discrete form of the transport equation. Chapter \ref{cha:transport_sweeps} also provides more details on the transport sweep.

\section*{Parallel Transport Sweeps}

Massively parallel transport sweeps have been shown to scale up to 750,000 cores on logically Cartesian grids using Texas A\&M's flagship deterministic transport code, PDT \cite{mpadams2013,mpadams2015}.
Chapter \ref{cha:parallel_transport} describes the basics of a parallel sweep algorithm, and specifically describes the KBA algorithm \cite{KBA} and PDT's extension of the KBA algorithm.
This chapter also describes PDT's performance model, which predicts the sweep time given a set of partitioning parameters.

\section*{Unstructured Meshing and Load Balancing in PDT}

In order to solve a wider set of problems, an unstructured meshing capability was implemented in PDT.
However, unstructured meshes may lead to imbalanced partitions, or different numbers of mesh cells per processor.
To address this, two load-balancing algorithms have been implemented in PDT, the original load-balancing algorithm and the load-balancing-by-dimension algorithm \cite{mastersthesis,mc2017}.

\section*{Time-to-Solution Estimator}

PDT's existing performance model does not account for unstructured meshes and imbalanced partitions.
Chapter \ref{cha:tts} describes the time-to-solution estimator, a graph-based method that estimates the time it takes to sweep across a problem given a mesh, partitioning scheme, and machine-specific parameters.

\section*{Partitioning Optimization}

The time-to-solution estimator described in Chapter \ref{cha:tts} is used to optimize the partitioning scheme.
Chapter \ref{cha:optimization} details two optimization methods: a ``black box'' method that uses Python's scipy.optimize library and a ``human-intelligence'' method that prioritizes partition placement in locations that don't add cells to a mesh.
