	\end{center}
	\item Structured meshes are limiting when modeling complex geometries.
	\item Unstructured meshes introduce unbalanced partitions. 
	\item PDT (Texas A\&M's massively parallel transport code) has two load balancing algorithms that repartition the mesh in order to obtain a roughly equivalent amount of cells per processor.

\begin{block}{Ingredients for optimality}
\begin{enumerate}
\item spatial domain decomposition distributes the domain across processors (e.g., $P_x \times P_y \times P_z$),
\tcm{partition = dividing the domain among processors}
\item \tcm{aggregation} lumps fine-grained computations into ``tasks''
\begin{itemize}
\item cell-sets
\item angle-sets
\item energy-group-sets

\begin{block}{Usefulness of a performance model}
\begin{enumerate}
\item When a (deterministic) scheduling algorithm is well understood, stage counts can be \fbox{predicted} with significant benefits.
\item In a nutshell, we have a \tcr{performance model} that depends on the processor partition, the aggregation factors, the scheduler, and \tcr{machine parameters} (grind time, latency). \\
PDT runs in {\bf \tcr{auto-mode}} and picks the optimal solution to traverse the TDG's.
% \[
% T_{\text{sweeps}} = N_\text{stages}
% \left( T_\text{work function} + 3T_\text{latency} +
% N_\text{bytes}T_\text{band-width} + A_x A_y A_z N_\text{?}
% \left( T_\text{cell} + A_m
% \left(T_\text{mom}+A_g T\text{g}
% \right)\right)\right)
% \]
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

%\begin{block}{Optimality}
%\ben
%\item Execute the sweeps in the \tcr{fewest possible stages}
%\item Have a performance model (function of problem dimension, machine parameters, partition, aggregation)
%\item Have an optimization of the performance model to select the best aggregation factors

    \begin{itemize}
      \item PDT using unstructured meshes has been a priority since early 2014. 
      \item Unstructured meshes allow for simulation of a wider and more general variety of problems.
      \item Three unstructured mesh types are supported in PDT:
        \begin{itemize}
          \item Triangle (2D and 2D extruded triangular/prismatic meshes).
          \item Spiderweb (2D and 2D extruded prismatic meshes).

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Cut lines'' in 2D (cut planes for 3D) are used to slice through the mesh in the $x$, $y$, and $z$ dimensions.
\item The cut planes form brick partitions, called subsets, that have unstructured meshes inside of them. 
\item The subsets are distributed amongst the processors.

LBD: a more efficient load-balancing approach:\\
Take a 3D mesh.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  Slice it in axial layers such that each layer has about the same \# of cells.
    \item  Then, for each layer, slice it in columns such that each column has about the same \# of cells.
    \item Then, for each column, slice it in blocks such that each block has about the same \# of cells. 
\end{enumerate}
In practice, we often achieve close to perfect load balance. (typical imbalance is < 1\%)

\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Consequences of Load Balancing By Dimension}
  \begin{block}{}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Perfect load balance in some cases will come at the cost of optimal sweeping (as shown in the next few slides).
    \item Time to solution is the most pertinent parameter, and if keeping a more optimal sweeping grid means a less balanced problem, then so be it.
    \item With imbalanced partitions it is harder to characterize the idle time, or the time where a processor has no work to do, and thus obtain an accurate stage count.
    \item A time-to-solution estimator must be built to more accurately predict sweep time.

%\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Overview}
%\begin{block}{}
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item We need to optimize the cut plane location not for balance, but for the best possible sweep time.
%	\item We must build a time-to-solution estimator that calculates the time to solution for a given cut line partitioning and mesh cell density.
%	\item The time to solution estimator will be fed into an optimizing function that minimizes the time to solution. The cut planes corresponding to the minimum time to solution are the optimal partitioning scheme.
%\end{itemize}
%\end{block}
%\begin{block}{IMPORTANT}
%The time-to-solution estimator is a graph-based method that uses graph algorithms that rely on an acyclic graph. The partitioning schemes used CANNOT induce cycles.
%\end{block}
%\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
\begin{frame}[t]\frametitle{Time To Solution Estimator}
\begin{block}{}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Given a partitioning scheme, build an adjacency matrix.
    \item From the adjacency matrix, build Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), one for each quadrant/octant.
    \item Weight each DAG's edges based on the solve and communication time of each subset to its neighbors.
    \item Create a universal timescale and launch processes based on when graph predecessor has finished its work.
    \item When conflicts arise between octants, resolve with first-come/first-serve and adjust weights (time delays) of the losing graph nodes.
    \item Sweeping time is obtain at the conclusion of this process.
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
Using this as performance model, we can evaluate the qualities of various parallel partitions for unstructured grids.

  \begin{block}{}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Once the weight (solve + comm. time) for each edge are known, the next step is to order them on a universal time scale. 
      \item To do this, we calculate the sum of the longest weighted path to each node, and set all incoming edges to each node to this value.
%      \item To find the longest weighted path, the graph weights are inverted, and the shortest weighted path is found. The original edge weights are used to calculate the value of the longest weighted path.
      \item The resulting graph is thus weighted so that the incoming edge to each node represents the time at which that node is ready to solve.
