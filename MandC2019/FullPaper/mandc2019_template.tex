%      (2) Different versions of LaTeX have been observed to 
%          shift the page down, causing improper margins.
%          If this occurs, adjust the "topmargin" value in the
%          physor2018.cls file to achieve the proper margins.

\section{INTRODUCTION} 
Paper starts here with two blank lines before first section title.  Use 
8.5$\times$11 paper size, with 1'' margins on all sides.  Use one blank line 
before and after each subsequent section’s title.  Most of the formatting is globally
set by the specifications given in the \emph{mandc2019.cls} file.  
First-level section titles must be all uppercase and centered, and must 
be numbered in Arabic numerals as shown above.  Unlike the Word template, the body text and section titles for this \LaTeX\ template use 
11-point font.  We have found that the 11-point font in \LaTeX\ more closely 
matched the 12-point font in Word.  Introduce the topic of your work 
in this section.

The first line of a paragraph is not indented; rather add one blank line between 
paragraphs.  This is done automatically. If you are a \LaTeX\ expert you 
can likely define the established format characteristics in a more elegant 
manner than what is done here.  This is perfectly fine, so long as the 
established paper format/appearance is maintained.  This template is merely 
to assist with maintaining uniformity in paper appearance.

There are four types of reference styles: journal paper\cite{journal}, 
proceedings paper\cite{proc_paper}, book\cite{book}, and website\cite{website}.
References to websites are discouraged, but acceptable if absolutely necessary. It 
is the author’s responsibility to check links in the PDF file of your paper. 
All references should be cited in the text in numerical order, in order of 
appearance as [5-7].

The page limit for M\&C 2019 papers is 12 pages. It is strongly recommended that 
the length of any final paper should not exceed 12 pages.

\section{SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT MAJOR HEADING} 
\label{sec:first}

This is Section~\ref{sec:first}. It is followed by a subsection, that is, 
\ref{sec:second}. The style for subsection titles and all text in this template is defined 
in the \emph{mandc2019.cls} file.  Make sure to avoid widow/orphan lines.

\subsection{Subsection Title: First Character of Each Non-trivial Word is Uppercase} 
\label{sec:second}

Double-space before and after secondary titles is automatic.  Figures and 
tables should appear as close as possible to where they are first
cited, e.g., Fig.~\ref{fig:amdahl}, in the text.  Figures are numbered in Arabic 
numerals, with the caption centered below the figure, in \textbf{boldface}. For a better 
arrangement it is strongly recommended that all the figures must be placed in the``Figures'' 
folder. Triple-space before the figure, and after the figure caption.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.60]{./Figures/figure.pdf}
  \caption{SCALE/TRITON-NEWT Model of BWR Assembly in Order to Show and Example of a Figure and a Multi-line Caption}   
  \label{fig:amdahl}
\end{figure}

When importing figures or any graphical image please verify two things:
\vspace{-0.65cm} % THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ":" AND THE FIRST LINE OF THE LIST MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE TEXT LENGTH, CHANGE THIS VALUE DEPENDING ON YOUR NEEDS.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item Any number, text or symbol is in Times font and is not smaller than 
  10-point after reduction to the actual window in your paper
\item That it can be translated into PDF
\end{itemize}

Equations, such as Eq. (\ref{sample_equation}), should be centered and 
sequentially numbered to the flush right of the formula.

\begin{equation}
  \label{sample_equation}
  \mathrm{Speedup}=\frac{1}{\frac{f}{p}+(1-f)}
\end{equation}

The continuation of a paragraph after an equation should not be indented.  
All paragraphs, as well as section or subsection headings, are separated by 
just one single empty line.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection level and lower: only first character uppercase}

See Table \ref{table:example} for a sample table.  The ``tabls'' package is
recommended for improved row and column spacing.  Notice the caption appears 
above the table by setting the \verb!\caption! command immediately 
after the \verb!\begin{table}!. Tables are numbered in Roman 
numerals, with the caption centered above the table, in \textbf{boldface}.  
Triple-space before and after the table.

\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
  \caption{\bf Parallel Performance for the Sample Problem}
  \label{table:example} 
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 
   Number of & Wall-Clock & Speedup & Efficiency \\
   Processors & Time$^{a}$ (min) & (T$_{s}$/T$_{p}$) & (\%) \\ \hline
    \ 1 &  100.0 & \ ---    & ---  \\ \hline
    \ 2 &   52.6 & \ 1.9    & 95.0 \\ \hline 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

Acknowledge the help of colleagues and sources of funding, as appropriate.

\textbf{As an example:} The format for this template was adapted from the \LaTeX template for the PHYSOR-2018 conference posted and available on the Internet and 
most of the \LaTeX\ format definitions contained in this were already defined. The 
M\&C 2019 organizing committee deeply thank the PHYSOR-2018 technical committee 
for this great support.
