\section{INTRODUCTION} 
The steady-state neutron transport equation describes the behavior of neutrons in a medium and is given by Eq. (\ref{continuous transport}):
\begin{multline}
\vo \cdot \vec \nabla \psi(\vr,E,\vo) + \Sigma_t(\vr,E) \psi(\vr,E,\vo)  = \\ 
\int_{0}^{\infty}dE' \int_{4\pi}d\Omega' \Sigma_s(\vr,E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo')  + S_{ext}(\vr,E,\vo) ,
\label{continuous transport}
\end{multline}
where $\vec{\Omega}\cdot \vec\nabla\psi$ is the leakage term and $\Sigma_t\psi$ is the total collision term (absorption, outscatter, and within group scattering). These represent the loss terms of the neutron transport equation. The right hand side of Eq.~\eqref{continuous transport} represents the gain terms, where $S_{ext}$ is the external source of neutrons and $\int_{0}^{\infty}dE'\int_{4\pi}d\Omega'\Sigma_s(E'\to E, \Omega'\to\Omega)\psi(\vr,E',\vo')$ is the inscatter term, which represents all neutrons scattering from energy $E'$ and direction $\vo'$ into $dE$ about energy $E$ and $d\Omega$ about direction $\vo$. 

Eq. (\ref{angle}) is obtained by assuming isotropic scattering, discretizing in energy, and discretizing in angle using the discrete ordinates method\cite{discrete ordinates}:
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec \nabla \psi_{g,m}(\vr) +\Sigma_{t,g}(\vr) \psi_{g,m}(\vr)  = \frac{1}{4\pi}\sum_{g^{\prime}}\Sigma_{s,g^{\prime}\to g}(\vr)\phi_{g^{\prime}}(\vr) + S_{ext,g,m}(\vr).
\label{angle}
\end{equation}

This allows us to solve a sequence of transport equations for one group and direction at a time. The discrete form of the transport equation is solved via source iteration, described in Eq. (\ref{source iteration}):
\begin{equation}
\vo_m \cdot \vec\nabla \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) + \Sigma_t \psi_m^{(l+1)}(\vr) = q_m^{(l)}(\vr),
\label{source iteration}
\end{equation}
where the gain terms terms have been combined into one general source term, $q_m$. The angular flux of iteration $(l+1)$ is calculated using the $(l^{th})$ value of the scalar flux. 

After the angular and energy dependence have been accounted for, Eq. (\ref{source iteration}) must be discretized in space as well. This is done by meshing the domain and utilizing one of three popular discretization techniques: finite difference\cite{fd}, finite volume\cite{fd}, or discontinuous finite element\cite{Reed}, allowing one cell at a time to be solved. The solution across a cell interface is connected based on an upwind approach, where face outflow radiation becomes face inflow radiation for the downwind cells. 

PDT, Texas A\&M's massively parallel deterministic transport code, employs the transport sweep by with the process described above, using a finite element mesh and solving the discrete ordinates form of the transport equation using a discontinuous finite element approach and source iteration\cite{mpadams15, mpadams13}. Initially, PDT only swept on structured, logically Cartesian meshes. As the need to solve problems with more complex geometries arose, PDT added a support for arbitrary polyhedral unstructured meshes. However, this introduced imbalanced partitions, causing runtimes of problems to become unmanageable.


\section{SECOND OR SUBSEQUENT MAJOR HEADING} 
\label{sec:first}

This is Section~\ref{sec:first}. It is followed by a subsection, that is, 
\ref{sec:second}. The style for subsection titles and all text in this template is defined 
in the \emph{mandc2019.cls} file.  Make sure to avoid widow/orphan lines.

\subsection{Subsection Title: First Character of Each Non-trivial Word is Uppercase} 
\label{sec:second}

Double-space before and after secondary titles is automatic.  Figures and 
tables should appear as close as possible to where they are first
cited, e.g., Fig.~\ref{fig:amdahl}, in the text.  Figures are numbered in Arabic 
numerals, with the caption centered below the figure, in \textbf{boldface}. For a better 
arrangement it is strongly recommended that all the figures must be placed in the``Figures'' 
folder. Triple-space before the figure, and after the figure caption.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.60]{./Figures/figure.pdf}
  \caption{SCALE/TRITON-NEWT Model of BWR Assembly in Order to Show and Example of a Figure and a Multi-line Caption}   
  \label{fig:amdahl}
\end{figure}

When importing figures or any graphical image please verify two things:
\vspace{-0.65cm} % THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE ":" AND THE FIRST LINE OF THE LIST MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE TEXT LENGTH, CHANGE THIS VALUE DEPENDING ON YOUR NEEDS.
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
\item Any number, text or symbol is in Times font and is not smaller than 
  10-point after reduction to the actual window in your paper
\item That it can be translated into PDF
\end{itemize}

Equations, such as Eq. (\ref{sample_equation}), should be centered and 
sequentially numbered to the flush right of the formula.

\begin{equation}
  \label{sample_equation}
  \mathrm{Speedup}=\frac{1}{\frac{f}{p}+(1-f)}
\end{equation}

The continuation of a paragraph after an equation should not be indented.  
All paragraphs, as well as section or subsection headings, are separated by 
just one single empty line.

\subsubsection{Sub-subsection level and lower: only first character uppercase}

See Table \ref{table:example} for a sample table.  The ``tabls'' package is
recommended for improved row and column spacing.  Notice the caption appears 
above the table by setting the \verb!\caption! command immediately 
after the \verb!\begin{table}!. Tables are numbered in Roman 
numerals, with the caption centered above the table, in \textbf{boldface}.  
Triple-space before and after the table.

\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
  \caption{\bf Parallel Performance for the Sample Problem}
  \label{table:example} 
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline 
   Number of & Wall-Clock & Speedup & Efficiency \\
   Processors & Time$^{a}$ (min) & (T$_{s}$/T$_{p}$) & (\%) \\ \hline
    \ 1 &  100.0 & \ ---    & ---  \\ \hline
    \ 2 &   52.6 & \ 1.9    & 95.0 \\ \hline 
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}
